ATM interface using Java
This repository contains the Java code for a fully functional ATM interface, which was my first task as a Java Developer Trainee intern at Brainwave Matrix Solutions.
# ATM Interface Project

## Project Description
This project is a simple, console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation developed in Java as part of an internship task for Brainwave Matrix Solutions. The goal is to demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming principles by simulating basic banking operations such as user authentication, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal functionalities. The project is structured using multiple classes including `ATM`, `User`, `BankDatabase`, `Transaction`, and `ATMInterface`, each responsible for specific operations, making the code modular and easy to understand.

The interface is text-based and runs in a terminal or IDE console. It prompts the user to log in and provides a menu to perform transactions. The data is handled through simple in-memory structures rather than actual databases, making it ideal for learning and demonstration purposes.

## Installation
To install and run this project:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ATM_Interface_Project.git


2. Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code.

3. Compile all `.java` files in the project.

4. Run the program by executing `ATMInterface.java`, which serves as the entry point for the simulation.
