# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
ATM interface using Java
This repository contains the Java code for a fully functional ATM interface, which was my first task as a Java Developer Trainee intern at Brainwave Matrix Solutions.
# ATM Interface Project

## Project Description
This project is a simple, console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation developed in Java as part of an internship task for Brainwave Matrix Solutions. The goal is to demonstrate the use of object-oriented programming principles by simulating basic banking operations such as user authentication, balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal functionalities. The project is structured using multiple classes including `ATM`, `UserInterface`, `ATMOpeartionImpl`, and `ATMInterface`, each responsible for specific operations, making the code modular and easy to understand.

The interface is text-based and runs in a terminal or IDE console. It prompts the user to log in and provides a menu to perform transactions. The data is handled through simple in-memory structures rather than actual databases, making it ideal for learning and demonstration purposes.

**Implemented Features:**

- Balance Enquiry
- WithdrawAmount
- Deposit
- MiniStatement

This project was developed using Java in the Eclipse IDE and managed with Git.

## Installation
